        "Sorah Weiss is the artist and heart behind Made in Heaven Mezuzahs. Each piece in her collection is entirely handmade — shaped, painted, and finished by her own hands, one at a time. No molds, no mass production. Just clay, color, intention, and love.",
        "Sorah’s work is rooted in the Jewish tradition of beautifying mitzvot — the concept of hiddur mitzvah — bringing beauty and artistry to sacred acts. For her, the mezuzah is not just a religious object; it is a blessing made visible, a daily reminder of faith, home, and the love of Hashem at every threshold.",
        "Each piece is one of a kind. When you place a Made in Heaven mezuzah on your door, you are placing something that has never existed before and will never exist again — crafted just for you, or for someone you love.",
        "Sorah takes custom orders and welcomes every inquiry. Whether you have a specific vision in mind or want to trust her with creative freedom, she would be honored to create something meaningful for your home."
