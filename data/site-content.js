    quote: "Every \"kosher\" mezuzah  that is properly hung up in a doorway with the mezuzah prayer is a mitzvot, a blessing from Hashem, blessing your home, business and lives. Every mezuzah comes with instructions and the mezuzah prayer.",

        "Sorah Weiss is the artist and heart behind Made in Heaven Mezuzahs. Each piece in her collection is entirely handcrafted art pieces —  No molds, no mass production. Just raw terracotta clay, white stone or porcelain, designed (with the help of Hashem), fired in a kiln and finshed off with final touches.  Each mezuzzah is unique and special, which it should be when it is the home of the holy \"parchment\" that will bless and protect your home or business.",
        "Sorah’s work is rooted from her love of Torah and Bitachron of Hashem. She is Shomer Shabbos and in the Jewish tradition of beautifying the mitzvot of putting a kosher mezuzah on the doorpost of each doorway,  bringing beauty and artistry to sacred acts. For her, the mezuzah is not just a religious object; it is a blessing made visible, a daily reminder of faith, home, and the love of Hashem and saying \"Thank You, Hashem\" at every threshold.",
        "Each piece is one of a kind. When you place a Made in Heaven mezuzah on your door, you are placing something that has never existed before and will never exist again — crafted just for you, or for someone you love.",
        "Sorah takes custom orders and welcomes every inquiry. Whether you have a specific vision in mind or want to trust her with creative freedom, she would be honored to create something meaningful for your home.",
        "Sorah's background is in music, lyrics and writing, such as, \"The Rabbi (a musical)\" as well as other music and musicals and writings.  She is a painter and artist in many mediums. Years back she owned and operated a hand-dipped chocolate company called,  \"Le Chocolat Shoppe\" on Dempster, in Skokie, Illinois.  This Shoppe and catering company did centerpieces, hand-dipped chocolates, truffles, and candy creations.  She was also a photographer for many years.  Always creative and always giving credit where it belongs... to Hashem's generosity. ",
        "May you All be blessed by Hashem, for Good Health, Happiness, Love, and Prosperity."
